Solar Tweaks is a software that allows you to tweak Lunar Client to your liking and re-enable some features that are completely disabled such as Freelook, AutoTextHotkey, removing pinned servers, changing FPS text etc...

However, SolarTweaks is to use at your own risk. Editing Lunar Client source code is not allowed! You can read Lunar Client's Terms of Service [here](https://www.lunarclient.com/terms). We are not responsible for **any** damage caused by using Solar Tweaks.

# Usage ⚒️

When you launch the app, you will be welcomed by a user interface similar to the one in the original Lunar Client Launcher. This is on purpose, as we want to make Solar Tweaks look as close as possible to the original Lunar Client so users can easily switch between them without getting confused.

⚠️ **Please note that Solar Tweaks is not a replacement for Lunar Client. Solar Tweaks is a modification tool for Lunar Client**

Tweak and customize your game by going to the **Customize** tab, change the launcher and JRE preferences in the **Settings** tab and launch the game using any tab you want since the big green button is always there.
