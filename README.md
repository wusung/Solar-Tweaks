Solar Tweaks is a software that allows you to tweak Lunar Client to your liking and re-enable some features that are completely disabled such as Freelook, AutoTextHotkey, removing pinned servers, changing FPS text etc...

However, SolarTweaks is to use at your own risk. Editing Lunar Client source code is not allowed! You can read Lunar Client's Terms of Service [here](https://www.lunarclient.com/terms). We are not responsible for **any** damage caused by using Solar Tweaks.

# Dear Lunar Client (Moonsworth) 🌙
You probably won't like this project (just like the rest of our projects). This software is free software, do anything you want with the code, shamelessly reuse it, do whatever you want, we don't care. Our only goal is to improve the experience of players. Maybe take our modules as an example, and see if you can improve your UX (not gonna lie, your launcher and modpack both miss some important features). We are not saying that our launcher is perfect (nothing is perfect anyway), but we are really trying to make it as good as possible, to improve our user experience.

*Please don't sue us, there is no need to* 💖

# Installing ⬇️
You can download the latest version of Solar Tweaks from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Solar-Tweaks/Solar-Tweaks/releases). You need to download the version corresponding to your operating system (OS).

If you want a complete tutorial about how to install Solar Tweaks for your specific operating system, you can read the installation guide on [our wiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

# Usage ⚒️
When you launch the app, you will be welcomed by a user interface similar to the one in the original Lunar Client Launcher. This is on purpose, as we want to make Solar Tweaks look as close as possible to the original Lunar Client so users can easily switch between them without getting confused.

⚠️ **Please note that Solar Tweaks is not a replacement for Lunar Client. Solar Tweaks is a modification tool for Lunar Client**

Tweak and customize your game by going to the **Customize** tab, change the launcher and JRE preferences in the **Settings** tab and launch the game using any tab you want since the big green button is always there.
